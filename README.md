## Live Demo

**Gyararii** is running on **Heroku** at [https://gyararii.herokuapp.com](https://gyararii.herokuapp.com)

> **App sleeping...** as Gyararii and its API run on [Heroku’s free plan](https://www.heroku.com/free), when an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn’t receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep. When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager will automatically wake up the web dyno to run the web process type. **This causes a short delay for this first request**, but subsequent requests will perform normally. For more information, see [App Sleeping on Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/app_sleeping_on_heroku).

> **Monthly limit** as **Gyararii API** runs on [Cloudinary’s free plan](https://cloudinary.com/pricing), at which point **Gyararii is restricted to transferring data at 25 credits per month**. For more information, see [Cloudinary Plans](https://cloudinary.com/pricing).
