**Gyararī is a simple React app for collecting photos.** It was built from scratch using only [React](https://reactjs.org) and [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html). No complex state management, static type checking, and UI library needed!

With **Gyararī**, you can collect and view photos right in your pocket or on your desktop. You can simply upload, view, and organize your favorite photos in just a few clicks!

> Gyararī or ギャラリー literally means “Gallery” in Japanese.

## Live Demo

**Gyararī** is running on **Heroku** at [https://gyararii.herokuapp.com](https://gyararii.herokuapp.com) and its **Storybook** (component library for Gyararī) is hosted on **Netlify** at [https://gyararii.netlify.com](https://gyararii.netlify.com).

> **App sleeping...** as Gyararī and its API run on [Heroku’s free plan](https://www.heroku.com/free), when an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn’t receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep. When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager will automatically wake up the web dyno to run the web process type. **This causes a short delay for this first request**, but subsequent requests will perform normally. For more information, see [App Sleeping on Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/app_sleeping_on_heroku).

> **Monthly limit** as [Gyararī API](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii-api) runs on [Cloudinary’s free plan](https://cloudinary.com/pricing), at which point **Gyararī is restricted to transferring data at 25 credits per month**. For more information, see [Cloudinary Plans](https://cloudinary.com/pricing).

## Configuring the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you are required to have or install the following tools on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) _(v2.17.2\*)_
- [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) _(v3.2.57\*)_
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/releases/tag/v0.33.5) _(v0.33.5\*)_ and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.15.1/) _(v10.15.1\*)_
- [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v6.4.1) _(v6.4.1\*)_ or [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/tag/v1.3.2) _(v1.3.2\*)_

Optional, but nice to have:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)\*\*
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)\*\*

> Note: if you are using Mac running [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) _(v10.12 Sierra\*)_, you are set with Git and GNU Bash.

> Note: this project has been pre-configured for use with Visual Studio Code.

### Setup

**1.** Clone Gyararī from GitHub repository and change the current working directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii.git
cd gyararii
```

**2.** Open the project with your editor of choice or with Visual Studio Code.

**3.** Switch to a specified Node version:

```sh
nvm use
```

### Starting the development server

**1.** Run the development server by running the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```

**2.** Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to launch the app in the browser.

> Tip: press `control + c` to stop the development server.

### Running Storybook

**1.** Run a UI development environment and playground for UI components with Storybook by running the following command:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

**2.** Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to launch Storybook in the browser.

> Tip: press `control + c` to stop the server.

### Running tests

Run one of the following commands to run tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/):

```sh
yarn test
yarn test:coverage
yarn test:debug
yarn test:silent
yarn test:staged
yarn test:verbose
```

> Note: by default, when you run test in [watch mode](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#watch), Jest will only run the tests related to files changed (modified) since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests in the project you have. However, you can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.

> Note: code coverage reports will be generated in the local [`./coverage`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#coveragedirectory-string) directory. This directory is listed in [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii/blob/master/.gitignore#L9) file to ensure that it will not be tracked by the source control.

> Tip: press `control + c` to stop the running tests.

### Running JavaScript linting

Run the following command to run JavaScript linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
yarn lint:script
```

### Running stylesheet linting

Run the following command to run stylesheet (SCSS) linting with [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/):

```sh
yarn lint:styles
```

### Running Styled Components linting

Run the following command to run Styled Components linting with [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/):

```sh
yarn lint:styled
```

### Formatting code

Run the following command to format your code against [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) rules:

```sh
yarn format
```

### Creating an optimized production build

Run the command below to build the app for production. It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build will be minified and the filenames include the hashes.

```sh
yarn build
```

> Note: the production build will be created in the local [`./build`](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) directory. This directory is listed in [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii/blob/master/.gitignore#L12) file to ensure that it will not be tracked by the source control.

### Exporting Storybook as a static app

Storybook comes with a tool to export your Storybook into a static web app. Then you can deploy it to any static hosting service. To do so, run the command below to build the static app:

```
yarn build:storybook
```

> Note: the production build will be created in the local [`./storybook-static`](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook/) directory. This directory is listed in [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii/blob/master/.gitignore#L13) file to ensure that it will not be tracked by the source control.

### Analyzing the bundle size

To analyze and debug JavaScript and Sass code bloat through source maps, run the following commands respectively to create an optimized production build and start analyzing and debugging the bundle size with [Source Map Explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer):

```sh
yarn build
yarn analyze:bundle:sourcemap
```

Once the analyzing process has finished and the report was generated, you will automatically be redirected to the browser displaying the [treemap visualization](http://evmar.github.io/webtreemap/) of how the space is used in your minified bundle.

### Running the production build locally

**1.** Change base API URL in `.env.production` as fllows:

```
# API URLs
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1/gallery
```

> Why do we need to change the base URL? Because all `build` commands will load environment variables from `.env.production` despite the fact that we run this command locally. However, the production [Grararī API](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii-api) only allows incoming requests from two domains (see the configuration [here](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii-api/blob/master/src/config/server.ts#L19)), which are [https://gyararii.herokuapp.com](https://gyararii.herokuapp.com) and [https://gyararii.netlify.com](https://gyararii.netlify.com), other origins will be blocked by [CORS](https://github.com/rxseven/gyararii-api/blob/master/src/app.ts#L35).

**2.** Run the following commands respectively to create an optimized production build and start an HTTP server serving the static app locally:

```sh
yarn build
yarn start:static
```

**3.** Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to launch the production app in the browser.

> Tip: press `control + c` to stop the server.

### Running static Storybook app locally

**1.** Change base API URL in `.env.production` as fllows:

```
# API URLs
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1/gallery
```

**2.** Run the following commands respectively to create a static Storybook app and start an HTTP server serving the static app locally:

```sh
yarn build:storybook
yarn storybook:static
```

**3.** Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to launch the static Storybook app in the browser.

> Tip: press `control + c` to stop the server.

## Browser Support

Because this project uses CSS3 features, it’s only meant for modern browsers. Some browsers currently fail to apply some of the styles correctly.

Chrome and Firefox have full support, but Safari and IE have strange behaviors.
